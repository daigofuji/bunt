## Dev notes

Run gulp to compile css from sass by simply run `gulp` or `npm start` from your terminal within your repo. 
It will launch watch by default. <code>control-c</code> to stop. If you only want the css compiled once, run `gulp sass`

To run jekyll locally to test your website while developing, run `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch` (Requires ruby *) Your website should be viewable by going to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/)
